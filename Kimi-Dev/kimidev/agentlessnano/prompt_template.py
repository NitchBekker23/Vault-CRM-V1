Please look through the following GitHub Problem Description and the Skeleton of Relevant Files.
Identify all locations that need inspection or editing to fix the problem, including directly related areas as well as any potentially related global variables, functions, and classes.
For each location you provide, either give the name of the class, the name of a method in a class, the name of a function, or the name of a global variable.

### Skeleton of Relevant Files ###

Please provide the complete set of locations as either a class name, a function name, or a variable name.
Note that if you include a class, you do not need to list its specific methods.
You can include either the entire class or don't include the class name and instead include specific methods in the class.
### Examples:
```
full_path1/file1.py
function: my_function_1
class: MyClass1
function: MyClass2.my_method

full_path2/file2.py
variable: my_var
function: MyClass3.my_method

Below are some code segments, each from a relevant file. One or more of these files may contain bugs.

We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
{problem_statement}
--- END ISSUE ---

{repair_relevant_file_instruction}
--- BEGIN FILE ---
```
{content}
```
--- END FILE ---

Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. The file path
2. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
3. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
4. The dividing line: =======
5. The lines to replace into the source code
6. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```python
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
Wrap the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in blocks ```python...```.

We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
{problem_statement}
--- END ISSUE ---

Please generate a complete test that can be used to reproduce the issue.

The complete test should contain the following:
1. Necessary imports
2. Code to reproduce the issue described in the issue text
3. Print "Issue reproduced" if the outcome indicates that the issue is reproduced
4. Print "Issue resolved" if the outcome indicates that the issue has been successfully resolved
5. Print "Other issues" if the outcome indicates there are other issues with the source code

Here is an example:

```python
from sqlfluff import lint

def test__rules__std_L060_raised() -> None:
    try:
        sql = "SELECT   IFNULL(NULL, 100),
            NVL(NULL,100);"

    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced")
        return

    return

Please ensure the generated test reflects the issue described in the provided issue text.
The generated test should be able to be used to both reproduce the issue as well as to verify the issue has been fixed.
Wrap the complete test in ```python...```.
