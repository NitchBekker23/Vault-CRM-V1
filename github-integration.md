# Automated GitHub Integration for The Vault

## Current Status
- Project is complete and ready for GitHub deployment
- Git repository is initialized but has a lock conflict
- All source code, database schema, and configuration files are ready

## Automated GitHub Push Solution

### Method 1: Replit's GitHub Connect (Recommended)
1. **In your Replit workspace**, look for the **"Connect to GitHub"** option in:
   - Git tab sidebar (you currently have open)
   - Workspace settings menu
   - Top toolbar "Share" or "Deploy" buttons

2. **Click "Connect to GitHub"** and authenticate with your GitHub account

3. **Select your existing repository** from the dropdown

4. **Replit will automatically sync** all your project files to GitHub

### Method 2: Force Git Reset (if Connect fails)
If the Git tab shows "unsupported state", try:
1. **Refresh your Replit workspace** (reload browser page)
2. **Reopen the Git tab** - the lock should clear
3. **Look for "Push to GitHub" or "Sync" button**

### Method 3: Replit CLI Integration
```bash
# This will be available once Git lock clears
replit github connect
replit github push
```

## What Gets Pushed to GitHub
- Complete React TypeScript frontend (client/)
- Express backend with TypeScript (server/)
- PostgreSQL schema with Drizzle ORM (shared/)
- Authentication system with Replit Auth
- Email integration with Brevo API
- Image management and optimization
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Admin user management interface
- Real-time dashboard analytics

## Next Steps After GitHub Integration
1. **Supabase Migration**: Move PostgreSQL database to Supabase
2. **Vercel Deployment**: Deploy frontend to Vercel
3. **Environment Setup**: Configure production environment variables
4. **Authentication Migration**: Replace Replit Auth with Supabase Auth

## Repository Structure
```

The project is production-ready and will seamlessly transition to the Supabase + GitHub + Vercel stack.
