## Issues Identified: 6


### Priority 1: Mixed lazy and direct component loading
- **Type**: Ui Consistency
- **File**: client/src/App.tsx

- **Description**: Sales data showing October 2025 instead of current June

**Implementation Steps:**
- Update hardcoded October dates to June 2025
- Change month=10 to month=6 in API calls
- Update display text from October to June


### Priority 3: Hardcoded October dates in client/src/pages/performance-simple.tsx
- **Type**: Data Accuracy

### Priority 5: Commission references in server/storage.ts
- **Type**: Feature Removal
- **File**: server/storage.ts
- **Impact**: Unnecessary commission data displayed
- **Description**: Commission system needs to be removed as requested

**Implementation Steps:**
- Remove commission calculations from backend

### Priority 6: Commission references in client/src/pages/performance-direct.tsx
- **Type**: Feature Removal
- **File**: client/src/pages/performance-direct.tsx
- **Impact**: Unnecessary commission data displayed
- **Description**: Commission system needs to be removed as requested

**Implementation Steps:**

## Recommended Implementation Order:
1. Fix critical database schema errors first (stores/sales-persons API)
2. Fix client deletion functionality
3. Standardize component loading to fix UI inconsistencies
4. Update date consistency (October → June)
5. Remove commission system as requested

## Expected Outcomes:
- ✓ Stores and sales persons data restored in Sales tab
- ✓ Client deletion working properly
- ✓ Performance dashboard consistent between preview and full view
- ✓ Sales data showing correct June 2025 dates
- ✓ Commission data removed as requested
