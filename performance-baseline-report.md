## CURRENT STATE

### Performance Metrics
- FCP: 8500ms (threshold: 1800ms)
- LCP: 8748ms (threshold: 2500ms)
- TTFB: 346ms (good)
- Status: CRITICAL - 4.7x slower than acceptable

### Identified Bottlenecks
- 30+ individual Radix UI packages loaded (Impact: HIGH)
- Large charting library for analytics (Impact: HIGH)
- Excel processing library loaded on startup (Impact: HIGH)
- Animation library loaded globally (Impact: HIGH)
- Carousel library loaded but rarely used (Impact: HIGH)
- 3-second automatic refresh causing constant re-renders (Impact: HIGH)
- Zero stale time forces fresh data on every access (Impact: MEDIUM)

### Critical Dependencies

**Authentication Flow:**
  - App.tsx → auth context
  - All pages → requireAuth middleware
  - Header → user data from auth

**Data Flow:**
  - Dashboard → inventory + clients + sales APIs
  - Clients → client API + purchase history
  - Inventory → items + images + SKU data

**Critical Paths:**
  - Login → Dashboard (must be fast)
  - Dashboard → Inventory/Clients (core features)
  - Data mutations → Cache invalidation

**Safe To Optimize:**
  - Reports generation
  - Analytics calculations
  - CSV import/export
  - Settings pages

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Changes
- **Lazy loading authentication components**
  - Risk: Could break login flow
  - Mitigation: Never lazy load auth components
- **Modifying core data fetching**
  - Risk: Could break real-time updates
  - Mitigation: Test extensively with rollback plan

### Medium Risk Changes
- **Code splitting large components**
  - Risk: Initial load flash
  - Mitigation: Add loading skeletons
- **Implementing route-based splitting**
  - Risk: Navigation delays
  - Mitigation: Preload on hover/focus

### Low Risk Changes
- **Compression middleware**
  - Risk: Minimal - server-side only
  - Mitigation: Monitor CPU usage
- **Image optimization**
  - Risk: Quality degradation
  - Mitigation: Test with sample images
- **Bundle analysis**
  - Risk: None - analysis only
  - Mitigation: N/A
