# The Vault - Inventory Management System

## Overview

The Vault is a sophisticated inventory management platform designed for watches and leather goods. Built with TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL, it features a normalized database structure, multi-user authentication with role-based access control, and comprehensive inventory tracking capabilities. The system is currently production-ready with 4 users and 22 inventory items in the database.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components (shadcn/ui)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with HMR support

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **File Handling**: Multer for multipart uploads with memory storage

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (currently Neon, Supabase-ready)
- **Schema**: Normalized structure with brands → SKUs → inventory items hierarchy
- **ORM**: Drizzle with Neon HTTP adapter for serverless compatibility
- **Migrations**: Schema-first approach with push-based deployments

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect integration
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL sessions table with TTL management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (owner/admin/user)
- **Security**: Multi-factor authentication support with email/SMS codes

### Inventory Management
- **Data Model**: Three-tier structure (brands → SKUs → individual items)
- **Image System**: SKU-based inheritance with deduplication
- **Categories**: Watches and leather goods with extensible taxonomy
- **Status Tracking**: In-stock, sold, reserved, and custom statuses

### User Management
- **Account Requests**: Self-service registration with admin approval
- **Role Management**: Hierarchical permissions (owner > admin > user)
- **Profile Management**: Complete user profiles with contact information
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all user actions

### File Management
- **Upload System**: Image optimization with hash-based deduplication
- **Storage**: Local filesystem with cloud migration readiness
- **CSV Processing**: Bulk import/export with validation and error handling
- **Image Inheritance**: SKU-level image sharing across inventory items

## Data Flow

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Planned Development: Sales Management System (June 18, 2025)

### Vision
Transform inventory management into complete business workflow by implementing sales processing system that moves items from inventory to client purchase history via CSV bulk import.

### Key Requirements Discussed
- **CSV Sales Import**: Bulk process sales data from previous day
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Handle overlap between manual sales and CSV imports
- **Client Purchase Tracking**: Build comprehensive client profiles with purchase history
- **Inventory Flow**: Clear progression from in_stock → sold → transferred_to_client
- **VIP Classification**: Automatic client classification based on purchase behavior

### Technical Architecture Planned
- **Sales Transactions Table**: Link clients to inventory items with pricing data
- **Enhanced Client Profiles**: Add birthday, preferences, notes, purchase analytics
- **Composite Unique Keys**: Prevent duplicate sales (client_id + item_serial + sale_date)
- **Audit Trail System**: Track all inventory status changes with timestamps
- **Smart CSV Processing**: Preview conflicts, skip duplicates, detailed reporting

### Implementation Phases
1. **Database Schema**: Sales transactions and enhanced client tables
2. **Client Management**: Enhanced profiles with purchase history
3. **CSV Sales Import**: Duplicate-aware bulk processing system
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Purchase patterns, VIP identification, profit tracking

### Concerns Addressed
- Automatic duplicate detection without manual CSV editing
- Unified transaction system for both manual and CSV sales
- Complete audit trail for inventory status transitions
- Conflict resolution with detailed import previews
