# The Vault - Inventory Management System

## Overview

The Vault is a sophisticated inventory management platform designed for watches and leather goods. Built with TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL, it features a normalized database structure, multi-user authentication with role-based access control, and comprehensive inventory tracking capabilities. The system is currently production-ready with 4 users and 22 inventory items in the database.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components (shadcn/ui)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with HMR support

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **File Handling**: Multer for multipart uploads with memory storage

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (currently Neon, Supabase-ready)
- **Schema**: Normalized structure with brands → SKUs → inventory items hierarchy
- **ORM**: Drizzle with Neon HTTP adapter for serverless compatibility
- **Migrations**: Schema-first approach with push-based deployments

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect integration
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL sessions table with TTL management

### Inventory Management
- **Data Model**: Three-tier structure (brands → SKUs → individual items)
- **Image System**: SKU-based inheritance with deduplication
- **Categories**: Watches and leather goods with extensible taxonomy
- **Status Tracking**: In-stock, sold, reserved, and custom statuses

### User Management
- **Account Requests**: Self-service registration with admin approval
- **Role Management**: Hierarchical permissions (owner > admin > user)

**Target**: 40-60% initial load time improvement

#### 3A: Route-Based Code Splitting
- Split non-critical pages (Reports, Settings, Analytics)
- Keep authentication and core pages (Dashboard, Inventory, Clients) as direct imports
- Add loading skeletons and preloading on hover

#### 3B: Progressive Loading Strategy  
- Implement intersection observer for below-fold content
- Progressive image loading with blur-up technique
- Staggered component mounting for complex pages

#### 3C: Advanced Caching Strategy
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Intelligent cache invalidation
- Background sync for data updates

### Learning from Previous Failed Attempts
**What Broke Before:**
- Lazy loading authentication components broke login flow
- Simultaneous multiple optimizations caused mass rollback
- Modified core routing without proper testing
- Broke component rendering and data flow

**Safe Optimization Principles:**
1. **Test Incrementally**: One change at a time with performance measurement
2. **Preserve Critical Paths**: Never modify authentication, core data flow, or main navigation
3. **Rollback Plan**: Keep git checkpoints before each optimization
4. **Functionality First**: Ensure features work before optimizing performance
5. **Monitor Real Impact**: Track FCP/LCP after each change, not just theory

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 2 Target**: FCP under 6 seconds, LCP under 8 seconds
- **Phase 3 Target**: FCP under 3 seconds, LCP under 4 seconds  
- **Ultimate Goal**: Meet Core Web Vitals thresholds (FCP < 1.8s, LCP < 2.5s)

## Authentication & System Architecture Phase 2 (July 2, 2025)

### Identified Improvements for Next Implementation
Based on the successful Phase 1 authentication debugging, the following Phase 2 improvements are planned:

#### 2A: Complete User Management Enhancement (High Priority)
- **Admin User Profile Management**: Implement comprehensive user profile editing with role change capabilities
- **User Activity Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging system for all user management operations 
- **Bulk User Operations**: Import/export user data functionality for large-scale management
- **Role Transition Workflows**: Smooth role upgrade/downgrade processes with notification systems

#### 2B: Advanced Authentication Security (Medium Priority)
- **Session Management Optimization**: Implement intelligent session timeout and refresh mechanisms
- **Multi-Factor Authentication Enhancement**: Strengthen 2FA implementation with backup codes
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protect authentication endpoints from brute force attacks
- **Security Headers**: Implement comprehensive security headers and CSRF protection

#### 2C: Database Query Optimization (Medium Priority)
- **Authentication Query Performance**: Optimize user lookup queries with proper indexing
- **Session Storage Optimization**: Implement efficient session cleanup and management
- **Connection Pool Management**: Optimize database connections for authentication flows
- **Query Monitoring**: Add performance tracking for authentication-related database operations

#### 2D: System Monitoring & Alerting (Low Priority)
- **Authentication Failure Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for authentication issues
- **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: Track authentication flow performance
- **Error Tracking Integration**: Comprehensive error logging and analysis
- **Health Check Endpoints**: System status monitoring for all authentication components

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- **Zero Authentication Failures**: All user management operations work consistently
- **Sub-500ms Authentication**: All auth endpoints respond under 500ms
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Full tracking of all administrative actions
- **Enhanced Security**: Multi-layered security implementation

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Authentication Foundation First**: Complete user management enhancements
2. **Security Layer Addition**: Implement advanced security features
3. **Performance Optimization**: Database and query improvements
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Add comprehensive system monitoring

## Planned Development: Sales Management System (June 18, 2025)

### Vision
Transform inventory management into complete business workflow by implementing sales processing system that moves items from inventory to client purchase history via CSV bulk import.

### Key Requirements Discussed
- **CSV Sales Import**: Bulk process sales data from previous day
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Handle overlap between manual sales and CSV imports
- **Client Purchase Tracking**: Build comprehensive client profiles with purchase history
- **Inventory Flow**: Clear progression from in_stock → sold → transferred_to_client
- **VIP Classification**: Automatic client classification based on purchase behavior

### Technical Architecture Planned
- **Sales Transactions Table**: Link clients to inventory items with pricing data
- **Enhanced Client Profiles**: Add birthday, preferences, notes, purchase analytics
- **Composite Unique Keys**: Prevent duplicate sales (client_id + item_serial + sale_date)
- **Audit Trail System**: Track all inventory status changes with timestamps
- **Smart CSV Processing**: Preview conflicts, skip duplicates, detailed reporting

### Implementation Phases
1. **Database Schema**: Sales transactions and enhanced client tables
2. **Client Management**: Enhanced profiles with purchase history
3. **CSV Sales Import**: Duplicate-aware bulk processing system
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Purchase patterns, VIP identification, profit tracking

### Concerns Addressed
- Automatic duplicate detection without manual CSV editing
- Unified transaction system for both manual and CSV sales
- Complete audit trail for inventory status transitions
- Conflict resolution with detailed import previews
