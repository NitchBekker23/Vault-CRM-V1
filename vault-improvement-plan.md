# Vault System Improvement Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: High Priority Fixes (Week 1)

## Phase 2: Performance Optimizations (Week 2)

### Optimization 1: Missing error boundary for CSV upload failures
**File:** `client/src/components/bulk-sales-import-modal.tsx`
**Problem:** CSV upload errors can crash the entire component
**Solution:** Add React error boundary wrapper
**Impact:** Enhanced user experience and system efficiency

## Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements (Week 3)

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Add Unit Tests**: Create tests for critical business logic
   - Inventory status transitions
   - VIP client calculations
   - CSV import validation
   - Authentication flows

2. **Implement Error Boundaries**: Add React error boundaries for:
   - CSV upload components
   - Image display components
   - Client management modals

3. **Optimize Bundle Size**: 
   - Implement code splitting for large components
   - Lazy load non-critical UI components
   - Optimize image assets

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Add performance metrics tracking
   - Implement error logging and reporting
   - Create health check endpoints

## Implementation Guidelines:
- Test each fix in isolation
- Backup database before schema changes
- Monitor performance impact after each change
- Update documentation for new features
